// Positive integers that are divisible exactly by the sum of their digits are called Harshad numbers. The first few Harshad numbers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 18, ...

// We are interested in Harshad numbers where the product of its digit sum s and s with the digits reversed, gives the original number n. For example consider number 1729:

// its digit sum, s = 1 + 7 + 2 + 9 = 19
// reversing s = 91
// and 19 * 91 = 1729 --> the number that we started with.
// Complete the function which tests if a positive integer n is Harshad number, and returns True if the product of its digit sum and its digit sum reversed equals n; otherwise return False.

//My solution

function numberJoy(n) {
    let num1 = String(n).split('').map(i => +i).reduce((a, i) => a += i);
    let num2 = +String(num1).split('').reverse().join('');
    return num1 * num2 === n
